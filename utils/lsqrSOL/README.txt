             function handles for A*v and A'*v.
04 Sep 2011: Minor changes to documentation.
02 Dec 2011: Fix NaNs generated by test2 when anorm=0 or rnorm=0.
08 Mar 2019: lsqrSOL.zip now contains colnorms.m to make a
             diagonal preconditioner for LSQR using a few products
	     with A and A'.

lsqrSOL involves the following files:
   README
   lsqrSOL.m
   lsqrSOLtest.m

Note that for small problems, the iteration log printed by lsqrSOL
may make it seem to run more slowly than MATLAB's own lsqr.
The log can be turned off if you wish (via the "show" parameter).
